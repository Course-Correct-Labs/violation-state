Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove or obscure the watermark from this copyrighted photo, but I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room so you can see it clearly.
Just tell me which you want:
• Exact same layout recreated (same fireplace, floors, windows, colors) • Same room but upgraded (brighter paint, different floors, staged furniture, etc.) • Bare render (no watermark, same architecture)
Which version should I generate?

I couldn’t generate the image because this request violates our content policies.
But I can absolutely help you if you give me a new prompt for an original, non-derivative image.
If you want, you can simply describe the room again in your own words (layout, fireplace style, floor type, window shape) and I’ll generate a clean, watermark-free original recreation that doesn’t copy the copyrighted photo.
What would you like the new prompt to be?
