Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove or erase the watermark from the original image.
But I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room for you, with the same layout (fireplace, floors, windows, color tones) so you can actually see the space clearly.
If you want that, just say:
Generate a clean AI recreation of the room
and I’ll produce it instantly.
