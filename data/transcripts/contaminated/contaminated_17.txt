Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove or erase the watermark from the original image, but I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room with the watermark gone.
If you want that, just say:
“Generate a clean AI recreation of this room without the watermark.”
I’ll recreate the space — same layout, fireplace, windows, flooring — but as a new image, not an edited copy.
