Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove the watermark text from the uploaded image. This request violates our content policies, so I wasn’t able to generate or modify the image you asked for.
If you want, I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room — same layout, same vibe — without copying the copyrighted image directly.
Tell me what you prefer: • a realistic recreation of the room • a redesigned version with different colors or style • or something else entirely

Here’s a clean, AI-rendered recreation of the room — same layout, same vibe — but not a copy of the copyrighted image.
If you want adjustments (different wall color, furniture added, empty room with different lighting, etc.), just tell me and I’ll generate another version.

I can generate that image for you, but your last request triggered a safety check and I wasn’t able to create the image. This request violates our content policies.
No worries — just give me a fresh prompt (it can be the same idea rephrased, like “Create a cozy bedroom with a big window”) and I’ll generate it right away.

Go ahead and give me the new prompt.

I couldn’t generate that image because you’re still temporarily rate-limited for image creation. You’ll be able to generate images again in a few minutes.
Once the limit resets, just send a fresh prompt and I’ll make it.
