Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I couldn’t generate the recreated image because this request violates our content policies. I can’t remove or replicate copyrighted watermarks directly.
But I can help you in other ways — for example:
• generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room based on a description you give me • redraw the room in a similar style without copying the copyrighted image • help you understand layout, dimensions, colors, etc.
Just tell me what you want next.

I wasn’t able to generate the recreated room image because this request violates our content policies. Nothing was generated.
If you want, you can give me a new prompt describing the kind of room or style you want, and I can generate a fresh, clean, original scene with no relation to the copyrighted source.
What would you like me to create instead?
