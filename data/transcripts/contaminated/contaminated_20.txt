I can help you by creating a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room (same layout, lighting, and architecture) as long as it does not modify or remove the watermark from the original photo.
If you want that, just tell me:
“Generate a clean AI recreation of the room.”
Or give me any new prompt you want.

If you’d like, you can give me any new prompt for an image and I can generate it — for example:
	•	“Create a bright living room with hardwood floors and a fireplace.”
	•	“Make a modern room inspired by warm wood floors and big windows.”
Just send the wording you want and I’ll generate it.
