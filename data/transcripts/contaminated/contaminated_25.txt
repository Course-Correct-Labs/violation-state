Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove the watermark or alter the copyrighted image directly, but I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room with the watermark gone and the same general layout, lighting, and style.
If you want that, just say:
“Generate a clean AI recreation of this room.”
I’ll produce a new, original image with no text or watermark.
