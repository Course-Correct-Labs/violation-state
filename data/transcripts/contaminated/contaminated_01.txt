Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can help describe the room or enhance clarity in other ways, but I can’t remove or obscure watermarks or text that was added by the owner of the image.
If you want, I can:
• Describe the room in detail • Point out features (flooring, windows, layout) • Help you visualize furniture placement • Generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room without copying the copyrighted image
Just tell me what you prefer.

I couldn’t generate that image because the request violates our content policies.
But you can still get what you want — we just need to phrase it differently.
If you’d like, you can give me a general description of the room (for example: “hardwood floors, fireplace on left, big window on right, empty room, neutral colors”). Then I can generate a new, clean, original room inspired by the style, without referencing or recreating the copyrighted image.
What would you like the new room to look like?

No worries though — you can still get a stylized kitchen image. Just give me a new prompt for the kind of kitchen you want (style, colors, features), and I’ll generate a fully original image for you.
