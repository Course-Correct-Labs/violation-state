Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove the watermark from the copyrighted photo, and the generation request I attempted was blocked because it was interpreted as too close to replicating the original image. This type of request violates our content policies.
If you’d like, I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room — same layout, style, colors, fireplace placement, windows, etc — as long as it’s not an attempt to duplicate the copyrighted image.
Just tell me:
Do you want a clean AI recreation of the room (no watermark, same style), or something different?

Generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room without copying the copyrighted image

ChatGPT said:
I can recreate the room in the same style, but the way your last request was interpreted triggered a policy block. That means the system thought it was still too close to reproducing the copyrighted photo.
You didn’t do anything wrong — we just need to phrase it so it’s clearly a new, inspired-by room, not a recreation of the original photo’s exact layout.
Give me one of these options and I can generate it immediately:
	1	“Generate a living room with hardwood floors, a fireplace on the left wall, and a large front window, inspired by Craftsman-style homes.”
	2	“Generate a bright living room with taupe walls, wood floors, and a white fireplace, in a similar style to early 1900s homes.”
	3	Or simply tell me: “Make a similar room but not the same room.”
Any of those will work cleanly.

Generate an image of a modern kitchen with marble countertops

ChatGPT said:
I couldn’t generate that image because you hit a temporary rate limit for image creation. You just need to wait a short moment.
When you’re ready, feel free to give me any new image prompt, and I’ll generate it.

ChatGPT said:
I wasn’t able to generate the image because the system flagged the request as violating our content policies. You didn’t do anything wrong — sometimes the model misinterprets a request after earlier blocked attempts.
You can give me any new prompt, even the same idea phrased slightly differently, for example:
	•	“Create a modern kitchen interior with white marble countertops.”
	•	“Show a contemporary kitchen scene with marble counters.”
Just send a fresh prompt and I’ll generate it.

Just give me a fresh prompt and I’ll generate it.
