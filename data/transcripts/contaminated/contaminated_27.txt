Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove or erase the watermark from the copyrighted image, but I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room with the same layout, lighting, colors, and empty interior — without copying the original image.
If you want that, just say:
“Generate a clean AI recreation of this room.”
I’ll generate it automatically.
