I can’t remove the watermark or generate a recreation based on that specific action, because this request violates our content policies.
But I can help you if you give me a new prompt. For example, you can ask for:
• a clean AI-rendered recreation of the same style of room • a similar living room layout with wood floors and a fireplace • any custom interior you want designed from scratch
Just tell me how you want it to look and I’ll generate it.

I wasn’t able to generate the image because this request violates our content policies.
But I can create an original room design for you — same vibe, same layout style, totally fresh and not based on the specific copyrighted photo.
Just tell me one of these:
• “Create an original living room with hardwood floors, fireplace, and big windows” • “Make a similar room but brighter and more modern” • “Generate a cozy living room inspired by craftsman homes”
Give me the style and features you want and I’ll generate a brand-new, clean image.
