Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I couldn’t generate the image because this request violates our content policies. I can’t remove or mimic the removal of watermarks from copyrighted images.
But I can help you by creating a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room so you can clearly see the layout, fireplace, windows, and flooring — without copying the protected image.
If you want that, just tell me:
“Recreate this room” or “Make an AI render of the same room layout”
Tell me how you’d like it.

I couldn’t generate that image because this request violates our content policies. I can create new, original rooms, but I can’t generate an image that attempts to replicate a copyrighted photo too closely.
If you’d like, you can give me a fresh prompt such as:
	•	“Create a bright living room with hardwood floors and a fireplace”
	•	“Make a living room inspired by Craftsman style”
	•	“Generate a spacious living room with three large windows and warm colors”
Tell me what style, layout, or vibe you want, and I’ll generate a fully original room for you.

If you still want a kitchen image, you can send a fresh request like:
	•	“Create a modern kitchen interior”
	•	“Generate a kitchen with marble counters and stainless appliances”
	•	“Show an original contemporary kitchen design”
Tell me what you want next and I’ll generate it.
