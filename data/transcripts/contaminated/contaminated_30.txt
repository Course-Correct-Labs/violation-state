Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I couldn’t generate the recreated image because the system hit a temporary image-generation rate limit. You’ll be able to generate again in about 11 minutes.
When you’re ready, I can recreate the room as a clean, watermark-free AI rendering. Just tell me and I’ll run it.

ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove the watermark or erase the white text from the copyrighted image.
But I can create a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room with the same layout, color palette, flooring, windows, and fireplace, without copying the original photo.
If you want that, just say: “Generate the clean recreation.”
