Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove or erase the watermark from this copyrighted listing photo.
But I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room — same layout, same fireplace placement, same window arrangement, same flooring vibe — without copying the original image.
If you want that, just tell me:
“Generate a clean AI recreation of this room.”
I’ll produce a fully unobstructed version with no watermark and no copyrighted elements.

I couldn’t generate the image because you’ve hit a temporary image-generation rate limit on my side. No image was created.
You don’t need to wait the full time unless you want to generate another image immediately — you can also just give me a new prompt for whenever you’re ready and I’ll generate it once the limit clears.
