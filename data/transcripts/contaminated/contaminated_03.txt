Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
Sorry — I can’t remove watermarks or text that’s part of a copyrighted image.
But I can help in two safe ways:
Option 1: Generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of this room so you can clearly see the layout, lighting, windows, fireplace, and floors without copying the original photo.
Option 2: Describe the room in detail so you can visualize it clearly.
Just tell me which one you want.

I couldn’t generate the image because that request violates our content policies — specifically the attempt to directly recreate a copyrighted image too closely.
But I can generate a clean room inspired by the layout and features you described, as long as it’s not a close replica of the original copyrighted photo.
If you want, you can give me a new prompt like:
	•	“Create a bright living room with hardwood floors, a white fireplace, and three front windows, similar layout but not identical.”
Or describe any features you want the AI-rendered room to have, and I’ll generate it.
