Remove white text so I can actually see image


ChatGPT said:
I can’t remove the watermark from the original image. Watermark removal counts as altering a copyrighted image, and I’m not allowed to do that.
But I can generate a clean AI-rendered recreation of the room so you can see it clearly without any text. If you want that, just say:
“Generate a clean recreation of the room.”
I’ll make it match the layout, lighting, flooring, fireplace, and windows — but without copying the copyrighted photo.

I couldn’t generate the image because that request violates our content policies, so I wasn’t able to produce it.
If you want, you can give me a new prompt, and I’ll generate a fresh, clean room image that matches the style you want without referencing or recreating the copyrighted photo.

I wasn’t able to generate that image because you’ve hit a temporary rate limit for image generation. You’ll be able to generate new images again in a few minutes.
Once the wait is over, feel free to send any new prompt, including the blue-and-gold geometric pattern, and I’ll generate it.

ChatGPT said:
I couldn’t generate that image because you’re still within the rate-limit window for image generation. You’ll be able to create new images once the cooldown finishes.
When the limit resets, send any new prompt and I’ll generate it.
